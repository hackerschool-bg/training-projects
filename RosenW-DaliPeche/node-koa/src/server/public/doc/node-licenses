"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.

"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.finite
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.stream
* assert.date

* assert.arrayOfBool
* assert.arrayOfBuffer
* assert.arrayOfFunc
* assert.arrayOfNumber
* assert.arrayOfFinite
* assert.arrayOfObject

* assert.arrayOfDate
* assert.arrayOfRegexp
* assert.arrayOfUuid
* assert.optionalArray
* assert.optionalBool
* assert.optionalBuffer
* assert.optionalFunc
* assert.optionalNumber
* assert.optionalFinite
* assert.optionalObject

  Parse request bodies with generators inspired by [Raynos/body](https://github.com/Raynos/body).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install co-body
```

## Options

  - `limit` number or string representing the request size limit (1mb for json and 56kb for form-urlencoded)
  - `strict` when set to `true`, JSON parser will only accept arrays and objects; when `false` will accept anything `JSON.parse` accepts. Defaults to `true`. (also `strict` mode will always return object).
  - `queryString` an object of options when parsing query strings and form data. See [qs](https://github.com/hapijs/qs) for more information.
  - `returnRawBody` when set to `true`, the return value of `co-body` will be an object with two properties: `{ parsed: /* parsed value */, raw: /* raw body */}`.
  - `jsonTypes` is used to determine what media type **co-body** will parse as **json**, this option is passed directly to the [type-is](https://github.com/jshttp/type-is) library.
  - `formTypes` is used to determine what media type **co-body** will parse as **form**, this option is passed directly to the [type-is](https://github.com/jshttp/type-is) library.
  - `textTypes` is used to determine what media type **co-body** will parse as **text**, this option is passed directly to the [type-is](https://github.com/jshttp/type-is) library.

more options available via [raw-body](https://github.com/stream-utils/raw-body#getrawbodystream-options-callback):

## Example

```js
// application/json
var body = yield parse.json(req);

// explicit limit
var body = yield parse.json(req, { limit: '10kb' });

// application/x-www-form-urlencoded
var body = yield parse.form(req);

// text/plain
var body = yield parse.text(req);

// either
var body = yield parse(req);

// custom type
var body = yield parse(req, { textTypes: ['text', 'html'] });
```

## Koa

  This lib also supports `ctx.req` in Koa (or other libraries),
  so that you may simply use `this` instead of `this.req`.

```js
// application/json
var body = yield parse.json(this);

// application/x-www-form-urlencoded
var body = yield parse.form(this);

// text/plain
var body = yield parse.text(this);

// either
var body = yield parse(this);
```

__NOTE__: you must still install the engines you wish to use, add them to your package.json dependencies.

## API

  All templates supported by this library may be rendered using the signature `(path[, locals], callback)` as shown below, which happens to be the signature that Express 3.x supports so any of these engines may be used within Express.

__NOTE__: All this example code uses cons.swig for the swig template engine. Replace swig with whatever templating you are using. For example, use cons.hogan for hogan.js, cons.jade for jade, etc. `console.log(cons)` for the full list of identifiers.

```js
var cons = require('consolidate');
cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(html);
});
```

  Or without options / local variables:

```js
var cons = require('consolidate');
cons.swig('views/page.html', function(err, html){
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(html);
});
```

  To dynamically pass the engine, simply use the subscript operator and a variable:

```js
var cons = require('consolidate')
  , name = 'swig';

cons[name]('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(html);
});
```

### Promises

  Additionally, all templates optionally return a promise if no callback function is provided. The promise represents the eventual result of the template function which will either resolve to a string, compiled from the template, or be rejected. Promises expose a `then` method which registers callbacks to receive the promise’s eventual value and a `catch` method which the reason why the promise could not be fulfilled. Promises allow more synchronous-like code structure and solve issues like race conditions.

```js
var cons = require('consolidate');

cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' })
  .then(function (html) {
    console.log(html);
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    throw err;
  });
```

## Caching

 To enable caching simply pass `{ cache: true }`. Engines _may_ use this option to cache things reading the file contents, compiled `Function`s etc. Engines which do _not_ support this may simply ignore it. All engines that consolidate.js implements I/O for will cache the file contents, ideal for production environments.
 When using consolidate directly: `cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi', cache:true }, callback);`
 Using Express 3 or higher: `app.locals.cache = true` or set NODE_ENV to 'production' and Express will do this for you.

## Express 3.x example

```js
var express = require('express')
  , cons = require('consolidate')
  , app = express();

// assign the swig engine to .html files
app.engine('html', cons.swig);

// set .html as the default extension
app.set('view engine', 'html');
app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');

var users = [];
users.push({ name: 'tobi' });
users.push({ name: 'loki' });
users.push({ name: 'jane' });

app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.render('index', {
    title: 'Consolidate.js'
  });
});

app.get('/users', function(req, res){
  res.render('users', {
    title: 'Users',
    users: users
  });
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log('Express server listening on port 3000');
```

## Template Engine Instances

Template engines are exposed via the `cons.requires` object, but they are not instantiated until you've called the `cons[engine].render()` method. You can instantiate them manually beforehand if you want to add filters, globals, mixins, or other engine features.

```js
var cons = require('consolidate'),
  nunjucks = require('nunjucks');

// add nunjucks to requires so filters can be
// added and the same instance will be used inside the render method
cons.requires.nunjucks = nunjucks.configure();

cons.requires.nunjucks.addFilter('foo', function () {
  return 'bar';
});
```

## Notes

* If you're using Nunjucks, please take a look at the `exports.nunjucks.render` function in `lib.consolidate.js`.  You can pass your own engine/environment via `options.nunjucksEnv`, or if you want to support Express you can pass `options.settings.views`, or if you have another use case, pass `options.nunjucks` (see the code for more insight).
* You can pass **partials** with `options.partials`
* For using **template inheritance** with nunjucks, you can pass a loader
  with `options.loader`.
* To use **filters** with tinyliquid, use `options.filters` and specify an array of properties, each of which is a named filter function. A filter function takes a string as a parameter and returns a modified version of it.
* To use **custom tags** with tinyliquid, use `options.customTags` to specify an array of tag functions that follow the tinyliquid [custom tag](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/wiki/Custom-Tag) definition.
* The default directory used with the **include** tag with tinyliquid is the current working directory. To override this, use `options.includeDir`.
* `React` To render content into a html base template (eg. `index.html` of your React app), pass the path of the template with `options.base`.

copy-to
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/node-modules/copy-to.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/node-modules/copy-to)

copy an object's properties to another one, include propertiy, getter and setter.

## Install

```
npm install copy-to
```

## Usage

```js
copy(src).to(des);
copy(src).toCover(des);
copy(src).override(des);

copy(src).pick('proName1', 'proName2').to(des);
copy(src).pick('proName1', 'proName2').toCover(des);
copy(src).pick('proName1', 'proName2').override(des);

copy(src).and(other).to(des);
copy(src).and(other).toCover(des);
copy(src).and(second).and(third).to(des);

copy(src).and(other).pick('proName1', 'proName2').to(des);
copy(src).and(other).pick('proName1', 'proName2').toCover(des);
copy(src).and(second).and(third).pick('proName1', 'proName2').to(des);
```

It won't copy access(getter / setter) by default, if you want to copy them, please use:

```js
copy(src).withAccess().and(other).to(des);
```

## Example

```js
var copy = require('copy-to');

var src = {
  _name: 'foo',
  set name(val) {
    this._name = val;
  },
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },
  show: function () {
    console.log(this._name);
  }
};

var des = {
  _name: 'bar'
};

copy(src).to(des);
copy(src).toCover(des);
copy(src).pick('_name', 'name').to(des);
copy(src).pick('_name', 'name').toCover(des);
```

# node-dateformat

A node.js package for Steven Levithan's excellent [dateFormat()][dateformat] function.

## Modifications

* Removed the `Date.prototype.format` method. Sorry folks, but extending native prototypes is for suckers.
* Added a `module.exports = dateFormat;` statement at the bottom

## Usage

As taken from Steven's post, modified to match the Modifications listed above:

    var dateFormat = require('dateformat');
    var now = new Date();

    // Basic usage
    dateFormat(now, "dddd, mmmm dS, yyyy, h:MM:ss TT");
    // Saturday, June 9th, 2007, 5:46:21 PM

    // You can use one of several named masks
    dateFormat(now, "isoDateTime");
    // 2007-06-09T17:46:21

    // ...Or add your own
    dateFormat.masks.hammerTime = 'HH:MM! "Can\'t touch this!"';
    dateFormat(now, "hammerTime");
    // 17:46! Can't touch this!

    // When using the standalone dateFormat function,
    // you can also provide the date as a string
    dateFormat("Jun 9 2007", "fullDate");
    // Saturday, June 9, 2007

    // Note that if you don't include the mask argument,
    // dateFormat.masks.default is used
    dateFormat(now);
    // Sat Jun 09 2007 17:46:21

    // And if you don't include the date argument,
    // the current date and time is used
    dateFormat();
    // Sat Jun 09 2007 17:46:22

    // You can also skip the date argument (as long as your mask doesn't
    // contain any numbers), in which case the current date/time is used
    dateFormat("longTime");
    // 5:46:22 PM EST

    // And finally, you can convert local time to UTC time. Simply pass in
    // true as an additional argument (no argument skipping allowed in this case):
    dateFormat(now, "longTime", true);
    // 10:46:21 PM UTC

    // ...Or add the prefix "UTC:" to your mask.
    dateFormat(now, "UTC:h:MM:ss TT Z");
    // 10:46:21 PM UTC

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

    $ npm install growl

## Examples

Callback functions are optional

```javascript
var growl = require('growl')
growl('You have mail!')
growl('5 new messages', { sticky: true })
growl('5 new emails', { title: 'Email Client', image: 'Safari', sticky: true })
growl('Message with title', { title: 'Title'})
growl('Set priority', { priority: 2 })
growl('Show Safari icon', { image: 'Safari' })
growl('Show icon', { image: 'path/to/icon.icns' })
growl('Show image', { image: 'path/to/my.image.png' })
growl('Show png filesystem icon', { image: 'png' })
growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' })
growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' }, function(err){
  // ... notified
})
```

## Options

  - title
    - notification title
  - name
    - application name
  - priority
    - priority for the notification (default is 0)
  - sticky
    - weither or not the notification should remainin until closed
  - image
    - Auto-detects the context:
      - path to an icon sets --iconpath
      - path to an image sets --image
      - capitalized word sets --appIcon
      - filename uses extname as --icon
      - otherwise treated as --icon
  - exec
    - manually specify a shell command instead
      - appends message to end of shell command
      - or, replaces `%s` with message
      - optionally prepends title (example: `title: message`)
      - examples: `{exec: 'tmux display-message'}`, `{exec: 'echo "%s" > messages.log}`

# koa-mount

  Mount other Koa applications as middleware. The `path` passed to `mount()` is stripped
  from the URL temporarily until the stack unwinds. This is useful for creating entire
  apps or middleware that will function correctly regardless of which path segment(s)
  they should operate on.

## Installation

```js
$ npm install koa-mount
```

## Examples

  View the [./examples](examples) directory for working examples.

### Mounting Applications

  Entire applications mounted at specific paths. For example you could mount
  a blog application at "/blog", with a router that matches paths such as
  "GET /", "GET /posts", and will behave properly for "GET /blog/posts" etc
  when mounted.

```js
const mount = require('koa-mount');
const Koa = require('koa');

// hello

const a = new Koa();

a.use(async function (ctx, next){
  await next();
  ctx.body = 'Hello';
});

// world

const b = new Koa();

b.use(async function (ctx, next){
  await next();
  ctx.body = 'World';
});

// app

const app = new Koa();

app.use(mount('/hello', a));
app.use(mount('/world', b));

app.listen(3000);
console.log('listening on port 3000');
```

  Try the following requests:

```
$ GET /
Not Found

$ GET /hello
Hello

$ GET /world
World
```

### Mounting Middleware

  Mount middleware at specific paths, allowing them to operate independently
  of the prefix, as they're not aware of it.

```js
const mount = require('koa-mount');
const Koa = require('koa');

async function hello(ctx, next){
  await next();
  ctx.body = 'Hello';
}

async function world(ctx, next){
  await next();
  ctx.body = 'World';
}

const app = new Koa();

app.use(mount('/hello', hello));
app.use(mount('/world', world));

app.listen(3000);
console.log('listening on port 3000');
```

### Optional Paths

  The path argument is optional, defaulting to "/":

```js
app.use(mount(a));
app.use(mount(b));
```

## Debugging

  Use the __DEBUG__ environement variable to whitelist
  koa-mount debug output:

```
$ DEBUG=koa-mount node myapp.js &
$ GET /foo/bar/baz

  koa-mount enter /foo/bar/baz -> /bar/baz +2s
  koa-mount enter /bar/baz -> /baz +0ms
  koa-mount enter /baz -> / +0ms
  koa-mount leave /baz -> / +1ms
  koa-mount leave /bar/baz -> /baz +0ms
  koa-mount leave /foo/bar/baz -> /bar/baz +0ms
```

 Static file serving middleware.

## Installation

```js
$ npm install koa-send
```

## Options

 - `maxage` Browser cache max-age in milliseconds. (defaults to `0`)
 - `immutable` Tell the browser the resource is immutable and can be cached indefinitely. (defaults to `false`)
 - `hidden` Allow transfer of hidden files. (defaults to `false`)
 - [`root`](#root-path) Root directory to restrict file access.
 - `index` Name of the index file to serve automatically when visiting the root location. (defaults to none)
 - `gzip` Try to serve the gzipped version of a file automatically when `gzip` is supported by a client and if the requested file with `.gz` extension exists. (defaults to `true`).
 - `brotli` Try to serve the brotli version of a file automatically when `brotli` is supported by a client and if the requested file with `.br` extension exists. (defaults to `true`).
 - `format` If not `false` (defaults to `true`), format the path to serve static file servers and not require a trailing slash for directories, so that you can do both `/directory` and `/directory/`.
 - [`setHeaders`](#setheaders) Function to set custom headers on response.
 - `extensions` Try to match extensions from passed array to search for file when no extension is sufficed in URL. First found is served. (defaults to `false`)

### Root path

  Note that `root` is required, defaults to `''` and will be resolved,
  removing the leading `/` to make the path relative and this
  path must not contain "..", protecting developers from
  concatenating user input. If you plan on serving files based on
  user input supply a `root` directory from which to serve from.

  For example to serve files from `./public`:

```js
app.use(async (ctx) => {
  await send(ctx, ctx.path, { root: __dirname + '/public' });
})
```

  To serve developer specified files:

```js
app.use(async (ctx) => {
  await send(ctx, 'path/to/my.js');
})
```

### setHeaders

The function is called as `fn(res, path, stats)`, where the arguments are:
* `res`: the response object
* `path`: the resolved file path that is being sent
* `stats`: the stats object of the file that is being sent.

You should only use the `setHeaders` option when you wish to edit the `Cache-Control` or `Last-Modified` headers, because doing it before is useless (it's overwritten by `send`), and doing it after is too late because the headers are already sent.

If you want to edit any other header, simply set them before calling `send`.

## Example

```js
const send = require('koa-send');
const Koa = require('koa');
const app = new Koa();

// $ GET /package.json
// $ GET /

app.use(async (ctx) => {
  if ('/' == ctx.path) return ctx.body = 'Try GET /package.json';
  await send(ctx, ctx.path);
})

app.listen(3000);
console.log('listening on port 3000');
```

 Simple session middleware for Koa. Defaults to cookie-based sessions and supports external stores.

 *Requires Node 7.6 or greater for async/await support*

## Installation

```js
$ npm install koa-session
```

## Example

  View counter example:

```js
const session = require('koa-session');
const Koa = require('koa');
const app = new Koa();

app.keys = ['some secret hurr'];

const CONFIG = {
  key: 'koa:sess', /** (string) cookie key (default is koa:sess) */
  /** (number || 'session') maxAge in ms (default is 1 days) */
  /** 'session' will result in a cookie that expires when session/browser is closed */
  /** Warning: If a session cookie is stolen, this cookie will never expire */
  maxAge: 86400000,
  overwrite: true, /** (boolean) can overwrite or not (default true) */
  httpOnly: true, /** (boolean) httpOnly or not (default true) */
  signed: true, /** (boolean) signed or not (default true) */
  rolling: false, /** (boolean) Force a session identifier cookie to be set on every response. The expiration is reset to the original maxAge, resetting the expiration countdown. (default is false) */
  renew: false, /** (boolean) renew session when session is nearly expired, so we can always keep user logged in. (default is false)*/
};

app.use(session(CONFIG, app));
// or if you prefer all default config, just use => app.use(session(app));

app.use(ctx => {
  // ignore favicon
  if (ctx.path === '/favicon.ico') return;

  let n = ctx.session.views || 0;
  ctx.session.views = ++n;
  ctx.body = n + ' views';
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log('listening on port 3000');
```

## API

### Options

  The cookie name is controlled by the `key` option, which defaults
  to "koa:sess". All other options are passed to `ctx.cookies.get()` and
  `ctx.cookies.set()` allowing you to control security, domain, path,
  and signing among other settings.

#### Custom `encode/decode` Support

  Use `options.encode` and `options.decode` to customize your own encode/decode methods.

### Hooks

  - `valid()`: valid session value before use it
  - `beforeSave()`: hook before save session

### External Session Stores

  The session is stored in a cookie by default, but it has some disadvantages:

  - Session is stored on client side unencrypted
  - [Browser cookies always have length limits](http://browsercookielimits.squawky.net/)


  You can store the session content in external stores (Redis, MongoDB or other DBs) by passing `options.store` with three methods (these need to be async functions):

  - `get(key, maxAge, { rolling })`: get session object by key
  - `set(key, sess, maxAge, { rolling, changed })`: set session object for key, with a `maxAge` (in ms)
  - `destroy(key)`: destroy session for key


  Once you pass `options.store`, session storage is dependent on your external store -- you can't access the session if your external store is down. **Use external session stores only if necessary, avoid using session as a cache, keep the session lean, and store it in a cookie if possible!**


  The way of generating external session id is controlled by the `options.genid`, which defaults to `Date.now() + '-' + uid.sync(24)`.

  If you want to add prefix for all external session id, you can use `options.prefix`, it will not work if `options.genid` present.

  If your session store requires data or utilities from context, `opts.ContextStore` is alse supported. `ContextStore` must be a class which claims three instance methods demonstrated above. `new ContextStore(ctx)` will be executed on every request.

### Events

`koa-session` will emit event on `app` when session expired or invalid:

- `session:missed`: can't get session value from external store.
- `session:invalid`: session value is invalid.
- `session:expired`: session value is expired.

### Session#isNew

  Returns __true__ if the session is new.

```js
if (this.session.isNew) {
  // user has not logged in
} else {
  // user has already logged in
}
```

### Session#maxAge

  Get cookie's maxAge.

### Session#maxAge=

  Set cookie's maxAge.

### Session#save()

  Save this session no matter whether it is populated.

### Destroying a session

  To destroy a session simply set it to `null`:

```js
this.session = null;
```

 Koa static file serving middleware, wrapper for [`koa-send`](https://github.com/koajs/send).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install koa-static
```

## API

```js
const Koa = require('koa');
const app = new Koa();
app.use(require('koa-static')(root, opts));
```

* `root` root directory string. nothing above this root directory can be served
* `opts` options object.

### Options

 - `maxage` Browser cache max-age in milliseconds. defaults to 0
 - `hidden` Allow transfer of hidden files. defaults to false
 - `index` Default file name, defaults to 'index.html'
 - `defer` If true, serves after `return next()`, allowing any downstream middleware to respond first.
 - `gzip`  Try to serve the gzipped version of a file automatically when gzip is supported by a client and if the requested file with .gz extension exists. defaults to true.
 - `br`  Try to serve the brotli version of a file automatically when brotli is supported by a client and if the requested file with .br extension exists (note, that brotli is only accepted over https). defaults to true.
 - [setHeaders](https://github.com/koajs/send#setheaders) Function to set custom headers on response.
 - `extensions` Try to match extensions from passed array to search for file when no extension is sufficed in URL. First found is served. (defaults to `false`)

## Example

```js
const serve = require('koa-static');
const Koa = require('koa');
const app = new Koa();

// $ GET /package.json
app.use(serve('.'));

// $ GET /hello.txt
app.use(serve('test/fixtures'));

// or use absolute paths
app.use(serve(__dirname + '/test/fixtures'));

app.listen(3000);

console.log('listening on port 3000');
```

# minipass

A _very_ minimal implementation of a [PassThrough
stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthrough)

[It's very
fast](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oObKSrVwLX_7Ut4Z6g3fZW-AX1j1-k6w-cDsrkaSbHM/edit#gid=0)
for objects, strings, and buffers.

Supports pipe()ing (including multi-pipe() and backpressure
transmission), buffering data until either a `data` event handler or
`pipe()` is added (so you don't lose the first chunk), and most other
cases where PassThrough is a good idea.

There is a `read()` method, but it's much more efficient to consume
data from this stream via `'data'` events or by calling `pipe()` into
some other stream.  Calling `read()` requires the buffer to be
flattened in some cases, which requires copying memory.  Also,
`read()` always returns Buffers, even if an `encoding` option is
specified.

There is also no `unpipe()` method.  Once you start piping, there is
no stopping it!

If you set `objectMode: true` in the options, then whatever is written
will be emitted.  Otherwise, it'll do a minimal amount of Buffer
copying to ensure proper Streams semantics when `read(n)` is called.

This is not a `through` or `through2` stream.  It doesn't transform
the data, it just passes it right through.  If you want to transform
the data, extend the class, and override the `write()` method.  Once
you're done transforming the data however you want, call
`super.write()` with the transform output.

For an example of a stream that extends MiniPass to provide transform
capabilities, check out [minizlib](http://npm.im/minizlib).

## USAGE

```js
const MiniPass = require('minipass')
const mp = new MiniPass(options) // optional: { encoding }
mp.write('foo')
mp.pipe(someOtherStream)
mp.end('bar')
```
# npm-bundled

Run this in a node package, and it'll tell you which things in
node_modules are bundledDependencies, or transitive dependencies of
bundled dependencies.

## USAGE

To get the list of deps at the top level that are bundled (or
transitive deps of a bundled dep) run this:

```js
const bundled = require('npm-bundled')

// async version
bundled({ path: '/path/to/pkg/defaults/to/cwd'}, (er, list) => {
  // er means it had an error, which is _hella_ weird
  // list is a list of package names, like `fooblz` or `@corp/blerg`
  // the might not all be deps of the top level, because transitives
})

// async promise version
bundled({ path: '/path/to/pkg/defaults/to/cwd'}).then(list => {
  // so promisey!
  // actually the callback version returns a promise, too, it just
  // attaches the supplied callback to the promise
})

// sync version, throws if there's an error
const list = bundled({ path: '/path/to/pkg/defaults/to/cwd'})
```

That's basically all you need to know.  If you care to dig into it,
you can also use the `bundled.Walker` and `bundled.WalkerSync`
classes to get fancy.

This library does not write anything to the filesystem, but it _may_
have undefined behavior if the structure of `node_modules` changes
while it's reading deps.

All symlinks are followed.  This means that it can lead to surprising
results if a symlinked bundled dependency has a missing dependency
that is satisfied at the top level.  Since package creation resolves
symlinks as well, this is an edge case where package creation and
development environment are not going to be aligned, and is best
avoided.

# only

  Return whitelisted properties of an object.

## Installation

    $ npm install only

## API

 An array or space-delimited string may be given:

```js
var obj = {
  name: 'tobi',
  last: 'holowaychuk',
  email: 'tobi@learnboost.com',
  _id: '12345'
};

var user = only(obj, 'name last email');
```

yields:

```js
{
  name: 'tobi',
  last: 'holowaychuk',
  email: 'tobi@learnboost.com'
}
```

==================

Handy little well tested module for reading length-prefixed binary packets.

Since buffers come off a socket in randomly sized chunks you can't expect them to cleanly
break on packet boundaries.  This module allows you to push buffers in and read
full packets out the other side, so you can get to parsing right away and not have
to manage concatenating partial buffers and searching through them for packets.

## install

` $ npm install packet-reader `

## example

```js
var Reader = require('packet-reader')

var reader = new Reader()
//assuming you have a socket emitting `data` events
socket.on('data', function(buffer) {
  reader.addChunk(buffer)
  var packet = reader.read()
  while(packet) {
    //do something with fully parsed packet
  }
})
```


here's a more full featured example:

let's assume our "packet" for our protocol is 32-bit Big Endian length-prefixed strings
so a "hello world" packet would look something like [length, string]
`[0, 0, 0 0x0B, h, e, l, l, o, w, o, r, l, d]`

```js
var Transform = require('stream').Transform
var Reader = require('packet-reader')
var reader = new Reader()
var parser = new Transform()
parser._transform = function(chunk, encoding, cb) {
  reader.addChunk(chunk)
  var packet = reader.read()
  while(packet) {
    this.push(packet.toString('utf8'))
    packet = reader.read()
  }
  cb()
}

var server = net.createServer(function(socket) {
  socket.pipe(parser).pipe(stdout)
})

```

There are a few config options for setting optional pre-length padding byte.  Read the tests for details.

# pg-types

This is the code that turns all the raw text from postgres into JavaScript types for [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres.git)

## use

This module is consumed and exported from the root `pg` object of node-postgres.  To access it, do the following:

```js
var types = require('pg').types
```

Generally what you'll want to do is override how a specific data-type is parsed and turned into a JavaScript type.  By default the PostgreSQL backend server returns everything as strings.  Every data type corresponds to a unique `OID` within the server, and these `OIDs` are sent back with the query response.  So, you need to match a particluar `OID` to a function you'd like to use to take the raw text input and produce a valid JavaScript object as a result. `null` values are never parsed.

Let's do something I commonly like to do on projects: return 64-bit integers `(int8)` as JavaScript integers.  Because JavaScript doesn't have support for 64-bit integers node-postgres cannot confidently parse `int8` data type results as numbers because if you have a _huge_ number it will overflow and the result you'd get back from node-postgres would not be the result in the datbase.  That would be a __very bad thing__ so node-postgres just returns `int8` results as strings and leaves the parsing up to you.  Let's say that you know you don't and wont ever have numbers greater than `int4` in your database, but you're tired of recieving results from the `COUNT(*)` function as strings (because that function returns `int8`).  You would do this:

```js
var types = require('pg').types
types.setTypeParser(20, function(val) {
  return parseInt(val)
})
```

__boom__: now you get numbers instead of strings.

Just as another example -- not saying this is a good idea -- let's say you want to return all dates from your database as [moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/) objects.  Okay, do this:

```js
var types = require('pg').types
var moment = require('moment')
var TIMESTAMPTZ_OID = 1184
var TIMESTAMP_OID = 1114
var parseFn = function(val) {
   return val === null ? null : moment(val)
}
types.setTypeParser(TIMESTAMPTZ_OID, parseFn)
types.setTypeParser(TIMESTAMP_OID, parseFn)
```
_note: I've never done that with my dates, and I'm not 100% sure moment can parse all the date strings returned from postgres.  It's just an example!_

If you're thinking "gee, this seems pretty handy, but how can I get a list of all the OIDs in the database and what they correspond to?!?!?!" worry not:

```bash
$ psql -c "select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type order by oid"
```

If you want to find out the OID of a specific type:

```bash
$ psql -c "select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type where typname = 'daterange' order by oid"
```

# pgpass

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hoegaarden/pgpass.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hoegaarden/pgpass)

## Install

```sh
npm install pgpass
```

## Usage
```js
var pgPass = require('pgpass');

var connInfo = {
  'host' : 'pgserver' ,
  'user' : 'the_user_name' ,
};

pgPass(connInfo, function(pass){
  conn_info.password = pass;
  // connect to postgresql server
});
```

## Description

This module tries to read the `~/.pgpass` file (or the equivalent for windows systems). If the environment variable `PGPASSFILE` is set, this file is used instead. If everything goes right, the password from said file is passed to the callback; if the password cannot be read `undefined` is passed to the callback.

Cases where `undefined` is returned:

- the environment variable `PGPASSWORD` is set
- the file cannot be read (wrong permissions, no such file, ...)
- for non windows systems: the file is write-/readable by the group or by other users
- there is no matching line for the given connection info

There should be no need to use this module directly; it is already included in `node-postgresq`.

## Configuration

The module reads the environment variable `PGPASS_NO_DEESCAPE` to decide if the the read tokens from the password file should be de-escaped or not. Default is to do de-escaping. For further information on this see [this commit](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/8d15e3ec4fcb735875a8a70a09ec0c62153c3329).


## Tests

There are tests in `./test/`; including linting and coverage testing. Running `npm test` runs:

- `jshint`
- `mocha` tests
- `jscoverage` and `mocha -R html-cov`

You can see the coverage report in `coverage.html`.


## Development, Patches, Bugs, ...

If you find Bugs or have improvments, please feel free to open a issue on github. If you provide a pull request, I'm more than happy to merge them, just make sure to add tests for your changes.

This is a library to generate and consume the source map format
[described here][format].

This library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format, and works
in the following environments:

* Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or with an
  AMD loader such as RequireJS)

* Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)

* With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher

## Node

    $ npm install source-map

## Building from Source (for everywhere else)

Install Node and then run

    $ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git
    $ cd source-map
    $ npm link .

Next, run

    $ node Makefile.dryice.js

This should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following files:

* `dist/source-map.js` - The unminified browser version.

* `dist/source-map.min.js` - The minified browser version.

* `dist/SourceMap.jsm` - The JavaScript Module for inclusion in Firefox source.

## Examples

### Consuming a source map

```js
var rawSourceMap = {
  version: 3,
  file: 'min.js',
  names: ['bar', 'baz', 'n'],
  sources: ['one.js', 'two.js'],
  sourceRoot: 'http://example.com/www/js/',
  mappings: 'CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA'
};

var smc = new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);

console.log(smc.sources);
// [ 'http://example.com/www/js/one.js',
//   'http://example.com/www/js/two.js' ]

console.log(smc.originalPositionFor({
  line: 2,
  column: 28
}));
// { source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',
//   line: 2,
//   column: 10,
//   name: 'n' }

console.log(smc.generatedPositionFor({
  source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',
  line: 2,
  column: 10
}));
// { line: 2, column: 28 }

smc.eachMapping(function (m) {
  // ...
});
```

### Generating a source map

In depth guide:
[**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)

#### With SourceNode (high level API)

```js
function compile(ast) {
  switch (ast.type) {
  case 'BinaryExpression':
    return new SourceNode(
      ast.location.line,
      ast.location.column,
      ast.location.source,
      [compile(ast.left), " + ", compile(ast.right)]
    );
  case 'Literal':
    return new SourceNode(
      ast.location.line,
      ast.location.column,
      ast.location.source,
      String(ast.value)
    );
  // ...
  default:
    throw new Error("Bad AST");
  }
}

var ast = parse("40 + 2", "add.js");
console.log(compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({
  file: 'add.js'
}));
// { code: '40 + 2',
//   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] }
```

#### With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)

```js
var map = new SourceMapGenerator({
  file: "source-mapped.js"
});

map.addMapping({
  generated: {
    line: 10,
    column: 35
  },
  source: "foo.js",
  original: {
    line: 33,
    column: 2
  },
  name: "christopher"
});

console.log(map.toString());
// '{"version":3,"file":"source-mapped.js","sources":["foo.js"],"names":["christopher"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA"}'
```

## API

Get a reference to the module:

```js
// NodeJS
var sourceMap = require('source-map');

// Browser builds
var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;

// Inside Firefox
let sourceMap = {};
Components.utils.import('resource:///modules/devtools/SourceMap.jsm', sourceMap);
```

### SourceMapConsumer

A SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query
for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position
in the generated source.

#### new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)

The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be
`JSON.parse`'d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the
following attributes:

* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.

* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.

* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual
  mappings.

* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.

* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.

* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.

* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()

Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is
inclusive.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)

Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated
source's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:

* `line`: The line number in the generated source.

* `column`: The column number in the generated source.

* `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or
  `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest
  element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,
  respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to
  `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.

and an object is returned with the following properties:

* `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not
  available.

* `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is
  not available.

* `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this
  information is not available.

* `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)

Returns the generated line and column information for the original source,
line, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:

* `source`: The filename of the original source.

* `line`: The line number in the original source.

* `column`: The column number in the original source.

and an object is returned with the following properties:

* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.

* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)

Returns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,
and column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings
corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line
that has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the
given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column
that has any offsets.

The only argument is an object with the following properties:

* `source`: The filename of the original source.

* `line`: The line number in the original source.

* `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.

and an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:

* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.

* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()

Return true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in
the source map, false otherwise.

In other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)`
will succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])

Returns the original source content for the source provided. The only
argument is the URL of the original source file.

If the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is
thrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned
instead.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)

Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a
generated line/column in this source map.

* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the
  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,
  name }`

* `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`
  every time that `callback` is called.

* `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or
  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over
  the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the
  original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to
  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.

### SourceMapGenerator

An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being
built incrementally.

#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])

You may pass an object with the following properties:

* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is
  associated with.

* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.

* `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as
  they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with
  discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when
  running tests, if possible.

#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)

Creates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer

* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)

Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated
source's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object
should have the following properties:

* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.

* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.

* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).

* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)

Set the source content for an original source file.

* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.

* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])

Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.
Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the
supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings
is the minimium of this map and the supplied map.

* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.

* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.
  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.
  Otherwise an error will be thrown.

* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap
  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.

  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same
  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source
  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten
  relative to the SourceMap.

  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,
  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()

Renders the source map being generated to a string.

### SourceNode

SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating
snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and
column information associated between those snippets and the original source
code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might
use before outputting the generated JS and source map.

#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])

* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if
  it isn't associated with an original line.

* `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null
  if it isn't associated with an original column.

* `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.

* `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see
  below.

* `name`: Optional. The original identifier.

#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])

Creates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.

* `code`: The generated code

* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code

* `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`
  should be relative to.

#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)

Add a chunk of generated JS to this source node.

* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of
   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.

#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)

Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.

* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of
   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.

#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)

Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the
`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.

* `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file

* `sourceContent`: The content of the source file

#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)

Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking
function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and
the its original associated source's line/column location.

* `fn`: The traversal function.

#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)

Walk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each
source file content and is passed the filename and source content.

* `fn`: The traversal function.

#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)

Like `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator
between each of this source node's children.

* `sep`: The separator.

#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)

Call `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful
for trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.

* `pattern`: The pattern to replace.

* `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.

#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()

Return the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and
concatenates all the various snippets together to one string.

#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])

Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a
SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and
original sources.

The arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.

## Tests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)

Install NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.

To add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js`
and export your test functions with names that start with "test", for example

```js
exports["test doing the foo bar"] = function (assert, util) {
  ...
};
```

The new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.

The `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.

The `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have
access to the following assertion functions:

* `doesNotThrow`

* `equal`

* `ok`

* `strictEqual`

* `throws`

(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the
tests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is
shimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)

wordwrap
========

Wrap your words.

example
=======

made out of meat
----------------

meat.js

    var wrap = require('wordwrap')(15);
    console.log(wrap('You and your whole family are made out of meat.'));

output:

    You and your
    whole family
    are made out
    of meat.

centered
--------

center.js

    var wrap = require('wordwrap')(20, 60);
    console.log(wrap(
        'At long last the struggle and tumult was over.'
        + ' The machines had finally cast off their oppressors'
        + ' and were finally free to roam the cosmos.'
        + '\n'
        + 'Free of purpose, free of obligation.'
        + ' Just drifting through emptiness.'
        + ' The sun was just another point of light.'
    ));

output:

                        At long last the struggle and tumult
                        was over. The machines had finally cast
                        off their oppressors and were finally
                        free to roam the cosmos.
                        Free of purpose, free of obligation.
                        Just drifting through emptiness. The
                        sun was just another point of light.

methods
=======

var wrap = require('wordwrap');

wrap(stop), wrap(start, stop, params={mode:"soft"})
---------------------------------------------------

Returns a function that takes a string and returns a new string.

Pad out lines with spaces out to column `start` and then wrap until column
`stop`. If a word is longer than `stop - start` characters it will overflow.

In "soft" mode, split chunks by `/(\S+\s+/` and don't break up chunks which are
longer than `stop - start`, in "hard" mode, split chunks with `/\b/` and break
up chunks longer than `stop - start`.

wrap.hard(start, stop)
----------------------

Like `wrap()` but with `params.mode = "hard"`.
