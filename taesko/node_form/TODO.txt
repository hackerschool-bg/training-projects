Design goal:
    Multi page app that serves static content and allows uploading downloading of files.

Page structure:
    /
    /:name - display content for the user with this name
    /:name/files - display all files uploaded by this user
    /:name/files/:file - specific files uploaded by the user.

Use a REST-ful API through GET and POST ?
