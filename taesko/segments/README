Segments fast task


Given a line with length L. For all points A = {(a(n-1), an)} on the line
with a given step `a` and all points B = {(bn, b(n-1))} on the line
find the segments between all these points that have a length of C.
These segments with length C will be colored in red. Find the
uncolored length of the line.
